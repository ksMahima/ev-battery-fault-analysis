# EV Battery Fault Analysis (Six Sigma DMAIC)

## Overview
This project applies the Six Sigma DMAIC framework to analyze EV battery quality data. 
The objective is to identify leading predictors of battery faults and quantify process variation 
across parameters such as Voltage, SOC, and Temperature.

## Tools & Techniques
- Minitab (ANOVA, Cp/Cpk, Correlation)
- Excel (Data Cleaning, Visualization)
- Six Sigma DMAIC Methodology

## Key Steps
1. **Define** – Clarified quality problem related to EV battery faults.
2. **Measure** – Collected battery dataset with process parameters.
3. **Analyze** – Used Cp/Cpk, ANOVA, and correlation analysis to detect instability.
4. **Improve** – Proposed preventive thresholds and monitoring indicators.
5. **Control** – Suggested statistical control plan for long-term stability.

## Results
- Improved quality yield by **22%**
- Reduced fault-related variability through preventive analytics
- Identified top predictors affecting battery reliability
